  I am all about knowing how to survive a zombie invasion â€“ as much as I am a firm believer of using the right tool for a given job. It can not be argued that killing zombies with a shotgun to the head is as natural a fit as peanut butter to chocolate. They simply just go together. 
</p>

<p>
  Now real zombies may not be a daily nuisance, but 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_computer">computer zombies</a> 
  are a daily pain in the butt to network administrators as well as software engineers alike. If you have 
  ever deployed a rails application into production that used some sort of exception notification, 
  then you may at some time seen some zombie attacks throw a bunch of exceptions. My solution a few 
  years back was to build my own ZombieShotgun module, see below.
</p>

<p>
  The idea is simple, include the module and add this line to the very top of your filter chain 
  <code>before_filter :shoot_zombies</code>. Just like in real life, if rails detects a zombie attack, 
  it will issue a 404 not found error in the beautiful rails syntax <code>head :not_found</code>.
  I love it when code models the real world! Please note that there are a ton of better ways to 
  accomplish user agent filtering, most notably, in your web server config... but that does not mean 
  this is not a fun module to use.
</p>


<macro:code lang="ruby">
module ZombieShotgun
  
  ZOMBIE_AGENTS       = ['Microsoft Office Protocol Discovery','Microsoft Data Access Internet Publishing Provider Protocol Discovery','FrontPage']
  ZOMBIE_ATTACK_DIRS  = ['_vti_bin','MSOffice','verify-VCNstrict','notified-VCNstrict']
  
  protected
  
  def shoot_zombies
    head :not_found if zombie_attack?
  end
  
  def zombie_attack?
    zombie_attack_on_directory? || zombie_agent_attack?
  end
  
  def zombie_attack_on_directory?
    attack = request.path.from(1)
    attack_dir = attack.index('/').nil? ? attack : attack.to(attack.index('/')-1)    
    ZOMBIE_ATTACK_DIRS.include?(attack_dir)
  end
  
  def zombie_agent_attack?
    ua = request.env['HTTP_USER_AGENT']
    !ua.blank? && ZOMBIE_AGENTS.any? { |za| za =~ /#{ua}/ }
  end
  
  
end
</macro:code>
