  Well HomeMarks v2.0 is done and ready for the public. You can download it from my 
  <a href="http://github.com/metaskills/homemarks/tree/master">Github project</a> page. It has a real simple <code>rake app:bootstrap</code> 
  task that I came up with over the weekend will have you running a local copy in only a few seconds, give it a try. Sometime 
  over the next few days, I'll move over the live site to this code base too. If you have not yet kept up on the implementation 
  mantra I set down for the HomeMarks v2 project, you might want to <a href="/2008/5/24/the-ajax-head-br-design-pattern">read an older post</a> 
  as well as this excerpt from the project README.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <div>
    HomeMarks was built using the Ruby on Rails framework with a heavy emphasis on object 
    oriented JavaScript to make AJAX requests to a RESTful back-end. Unlike most Rails 
    applications it does not use any inline JavaScript helpers nor does it rely on RJS 
    (Remote JavaScript) for dynamic page updates. Instead it is nearly 100% unobtrusive 
    JavaScript which uses simple HEAD or JSON responses to communicate to the objects on 
    the page. This has yielded very slim controller code which is decoupled from the 
    views and easily testable in isolation at a functional level.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>
  So what do I think of this implementation and writing all this object oriented JavaScript? Well â€“ its been real hard, I've been in 
  JS Hell-OO for the better part of a few weeks as I came closer to finishing the project. Coming from a self inflicted addiction
  to unit/functional testing in rails, it is very hard to get into the habit of opening the browser to test view code. A big part of 
  me hates writing all this JS without one bit of unit testing. I've heard that Prototype v2 will have unit testing, that would be awesome!

  So, bitching aside, I am very happy that my JS-fu is stronger. The end result besides all those buckets of water up the hill is that 
  I can now really appreciate the ruby object model and how prototype strives to make JS class construction follow its example. Kudos 
  really goes to Sam Stephenson for bridging the two object models. As I learned more about how prototype's classes work, I actually 
  learned quite a bit about ruby too. Using that knowledge I gave a talk at the 
  <a href="http://757rb.org/">Hampton Roads Ruby Users Group (757rb)</a> on the topic. You can download the PDF 
  version of the slides <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/757rb/files"> from the files section of the Google group</a> page. 
  Look for the file titled <em>OO JavaScript Class Construction</em>
