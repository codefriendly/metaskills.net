  I got a chance to meet Gregg Pollack at this years RubyConf, a great guy. In fact I seem to owe him alot. Not only did I get 3 mentions lately on the main rubyonrails.org site, but it appears I got one of my <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/f277e1d8fddfa417104c6fe095c15559f0c8713d">2.2 additions</a> mentioned in their new <a href="http://envycasts.com/products/ruby-on-rails-22-screencast">envycast that covers rails 2.2</a>. Sweet!

  So now it is my duty to help the Rails Envy guys to bank it Grossenbach-style. If you have not done so, go check out <a href="http://envycasts.com/">envycasts.com</a> and put $9 down on one or two of their great vids! This stuff is a great resource for any ruby-rails'ist. Put it on your TV and imagine your in your own little Orlando user group.
