  <img src="/assets/textmate_xcode_theme2.gif" alt="Xcode TextMate Theme" width="420" height="287" class="ml20 shadow floatr" /> I've been using Xcode for about 8 hard core months now and for all this time I have been using a theme I made that mimics the All Hallow's Eve TextMate theme with a bunch of custom key bindings that make Xcode more TextMate compatible. Here are links to download both below and a few notes I have put together. As I remember more of what I have actually done, this post will get updated. I do remember the first thing I did with Xcode for almost 3 days was just to customize the heck out of it and these files are the results.

<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td class="center">
      <img src="/assets/fonts_and_colors.gif" alt="Xcode Fonts & Colors" width="86" height="50" /><br />
      <a href="/assets/TextMate-All-Hallows-Eve.xccolortheme.zip">TextMate All Hallows Eve Theme</a>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  To use these download and unzip them. Please the theme in <code>~/Library/Application Support/Xcode/Color Themes</code> and place the bindings in <code>~/Library/Application Support/Xcode/Key Bindings</code>. That should be it. Hare are my notes for now on what the key bindings do.

<h2>Misc Key Bindings</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Command-W - Works on a file! Not the whole project window!</li>
  <li>Command-1 - Open File List</li>
  <li>Command-2 - Method List</li>
</ul>


<h2>TextMate Style Key Bindings</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Command-T - for Open Quickly</li>
  <li>I'll update this as I find more, it has honestly been so long I forget all the work I've done and just use this now as if it were TextMate.</li>
</ul>
