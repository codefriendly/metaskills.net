  Only now do I really get this image from <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000585.html">DHH's blog</a>. I am really beginning to despise SOAP for some reason, but I guess I will "get it" as I learn more about it -- as it seems to be the only way to do business with the big players out there. For a glimpse of some of my hell, check out this <a href="http://www.brendonwilson.com/blog/2006/04/02/ruby-soap4r-wsdl-hell/">Ruby + SOAP4R + WSDL Hell</a> article.

  Check XML and XHTML documents for Well-Formedness and Validity while editing them in TextMate with support for DTD, W3C XML Schema, RELAX NG, Schematron and XInclude.
