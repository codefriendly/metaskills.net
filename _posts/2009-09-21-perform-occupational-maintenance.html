  One of the things that bugs me about some people in the technology field is that they do not perform enough occupational maintenance. Today I just purchased <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/sdcoach/agile-coaching"><em>Agile Coaching</em></a> and <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/tibmac/beginning-mac-programming"><em>Beginning Mac Programming: Develop with Objective-C and Cocoa</em></a>. Both from the <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/">Pragmatic Bookshelf</a>.

  If you have not done so already, do yourself a favor and go to the Pragmatic Bookstore, check yo self, and get better at what you do! Here is my bookshelf to date.
