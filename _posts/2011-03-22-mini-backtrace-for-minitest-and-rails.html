<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/metaskills/mini_backtrace">MiniBacktrace</a> allows you to take advantage of the Rails.backtrace_cleaner when using MiniTest. This includes everyone using Rails 3 with Ruby 1.9.
</p>

<p>
  Just add 'mini_backtrace' to your Gemfile's :test group and your should automatically see a huge difference. Any additions to the Rails.backtrace_cleaner should now work.

Rails.backtrace_cleaner.add_silencer { |line| line =~ /my_noisy_library/ }
